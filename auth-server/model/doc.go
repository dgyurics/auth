// Package model defines common data structures used throughout the project.
//
// The structs defined in this package are intended to be shared and referenced by multiple packages
// within the project. They represent common data entities, such as domain objects or data transfer objects,
// that are used across different layers or modules of the application. By centralizing these shared data
// structures in the model package, it helps to maintain consistency and reusability throughout the project.
