// Package repository provides a database client and a set of methods for interacting with the database.
//
// The repository package abstracts away the details of interacting with the database, allowing the rest of
// the application to use a simpler, higher-level API for accessing the data. By centralizing database access
// in the repository package, it helps to ensure consistency and maintainability of the data access layer.
