// Package service provides a set of functions to handle the application's business logic.
//
// These functions are designed to be called directly by request controllers, allowing the controllers
// to remain simple and focused on handling HTTP requests and responses. By offloading complex business
// logic and database requests to the respective service functions, the application becomes more modular,
// easier to maintain, and less prone to errors.
